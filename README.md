# Falsebook
Just a website I am developing, full-stack, to show future employers.
If you stumble upon this feel free to give me pointers. Below is the progress documentation.


8/14/2019 Week-1: Front end in development. Loign and registration page base
                  code done, still needs to be touched-up for better look 
                  and made more interactive via JavaScript. Learning PHP for the server-side 
                  scripting for data management and security.
